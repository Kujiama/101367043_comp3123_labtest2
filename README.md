# React Weather App using Async/Await and OpenWeather API

Welcome to the Weather App project! This is a simple web application that allows users to retrieve current weather information for a specific location using the OpenWeather API. The project is built using JavaScript's `async/await` syntax for handling asynchronous operations, utilizing the `fetch` API to make requests, and managing `promises` effectively.

## Features

- **Current Weather:** Get real-time weather data for a chosen city.
- **Search Functionality:** Enter the name of any city to view its weather details.

#

- when loading the app the default city is set to Toronto
